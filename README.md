## Continue, Claude

> **Note:** This project uses Bun as the runtime environment, not npm. Please ensure Bun is installed before running this project.

This software aims to solve the annoyance of
- starting a claude.ai chat on the phone / web client
- finding yourself deep in conversation 
- wanting to explore the topic in depth, but the claude.ai rate limits you harder for longer chats

- bring your chat.json, system prompt, artifacts, attachments (chat history++) and continue your conversation in a super charged claude client
    - only text chat supported so far. support for multimedia coming
- bring your own API key
- save everything client side in Anthropic API spec 
- loom. implemented client side using gitloom
    - todo
